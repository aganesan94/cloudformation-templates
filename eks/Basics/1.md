# Basic of Kubernetes


## Overview

* Open Source container management platform
* Helps to run containers at scale.
* Providing Objects and APIs for building apps

## Types of Nodes

Control-plan (Master Node): Control Plane is the brain behind the K8s cluster
Data Plane (Worker Node): Runs the actual containers via pods.

## Components of Kubernetes

### Control Plane

* API Server: to interact with kubectl client (ReSTFul calls)
* etcd : Distributed key-value store
* controller-manager: Evaluates current vs desired state
* scheduler: Schedule pods to worker nodes

### Data Plane

* Consists of a bunch Worker nodes
* kubelet - intermediate layer between API and a node
* kube-proxy - manages IP translation and routing

DaemonSet - Single instance of pod on all
Deployment - A mechanism to roll back or deploy apps
ReplicaSet - Specific number of pods are always running
Job - Task running to completion
